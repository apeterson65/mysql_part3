all of the work done for this course was done in goormIDE
The Challenges.sql and schema.sql file are the work done in section 16. 
For section 17 the framework was done in nodejs going through goormIDE
I am launching the site using the command: node app.js
The app.js file runs the server and pulls all the files for the site together

the link I created for this site is:  https://andrew-sql-joinus.run-us-west2.goorm.io/
I am running it off port 3001
